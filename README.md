# porNo_open_source
Welcome! This is meant to provide a free and public algorithm for porn detection.
<br>
### Some ideas for contributing:
<ul>
<li>
Speed improvements! For example, a program meant to block porn on the internet shouldn't let any part of the site visited
load before the assessment of the site is complete -- it's important to have an assessment faster than the speed of pageload, hence the importance of speed improvements.
</li>

<li>
Expanding the list of porn sites hardcoded in the file! 
</li>

<li>
Others to be determined later!
</li>

</ul>

Thank you!
